# Ethymology
Mercury (/ˈmɜrkjʉri/; Latin: Mercurius) is a major Roman god. He is the patron god of financial gain,
commerce, eloquence (and thus poetry), messages/communication (including divination), travelers,
boundaries, luck, trickery and thieves; he is also the guide of souls to the underworld.
His name is possibly related to the Latin word merx ("merchandise"; compare merchant, commerce, etc.),
mercari (to trade), and merces (wages)
